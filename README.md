## NTLite GamerOS Configs for Windows 10

Changes made to the original GamerOS Windows 10 NTLite config from Txmmy and ChrisTitusTech that have added support in Windows 10 for:

- Working Wi-Fi/auto connection
- Working Bluetooth
- Working Microsoft Store and app installation
- On-Screen Keyboard (Tablet PC) - this had to be added due to an NTLite bug described here: <https://www.ntlite.com/community/index.php?threads/can%E2%80%99t-type-wifi-password.3094/>

This config also includes enabling .NET Framework 3.5 in the new .wim. This can be disabled from the "Updates" tab in NTLite if desired.

Tested on Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2021.
